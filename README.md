# Ping Wallet
An open source wallet for Cosmos based blockchains

Ping wallet is going to support three blockchains at the beginning. 

 - Cosmos Hub
 - IRIS Hub
 - Kava

We will add more blockchains later. 

## security consideration

Ping wallet doesn't ask for neither *mnemonic words* or *private key*. It only use keys saved in your trusted third hard wallet like Ledger or Imkey.
